Within the scope of the Original Helicopter Program, which was started on the basis of the knowledge, experience and talent pool gained during the ATAK Program, the design and production of critical systems such as transmission, rotor and landing gear, as well as structural and avionic systems, are carried out entirely using national resources.</p>

            In addition to the flight tests, the endurance, life and damage tolerance tests of the aircraft were carried out successfully on 2 separate structural aircraft. Within the scope of the project, 545 documents were prepared to be sent to EASA and DGCA. All documents for maintenance and maintenance have been prepared. As a result of all these studies, "TT32 Aircraft Type Certificate" was obtained from DGCA on 11 July 2016 for the HÜRKUŞ New Generation Basic Trainer Aircraft. On the same day, EASA's "EASA Validated Type Certificate" and the said Certificate of DGCA were made valid for all European countries. Thus, HÜRKUŞ became the first Turkish aircraft to receive a type certificate from the European Civil Aviation Authority.</p>

            <p>“ANKA”, the Turkish Unmanned Aerial Vehicle designed by the engineers of the Turkish Aerospace in cooperation with several local subcontractors, has left the Hangar with a ceremony held on July 16, 2010 at the Turkish Aerospace facilities after its assembly. Leaving the hangar, ANKA’s engine was also started, and ANKA aims to be the world's best operating system in its category.


            It is a Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) UAV Program. The UAV Program is a development project featuring three aerial vehicle prototypes, aiming to design and develop all ground systems around defined needs and complete the prototype and development tests. The Program features “Conceptual Design", “Preliminary Design and Development” and “Testing and Evaluation” phases. During the development phase, a System Integration Laboratory (SEL) was set up where all systems would be developed/interfaced/integrated.</p>

            <p>GÖKTÜRK-3 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Earth Observation and Reconnaissance Satellite System aims to obtain capability of imaging any region of the Earth with submeter resolution both in day and night conditions; and to satisfy SAR imagery needs demanded by both military and civil applications.
            GÖKTÜRK-3 SAR Satellite System Development Project has been planned to provide satellite and ground stations (one stationary, one mobile) launch and early orbit campaigns, and in addition to these engineering, maintenance and integrated logistics support services. In this context, GÖKTÜRK-3 SAR Satellite System Development Project was planned in two phases. The contract of the first phase (i.e. Phase-I) the project which includes the activities regarding Preliminary Design was signed between Presidency of Defence Industries and Turkish Aerospace as the prime contractor. The GÖKTÜRK-3 Preliminary Design Phase (Phase-I) was successfully completed in May 2016.</p>

            <p>Advanced Jet Trainer and Light Attack Aircraft HÜRJET is a single engine, tandem-seat with modern avionics and high-performance features, fulfills a critical role in modern pilot training through its superior performance characteristics.
            Combat variant provides a battlefield force multiplier through a wide range of mission capabilities and an extensive payload. HÜRJET Project has started to fulfil international and Turkish Air Force requirements by replacing aging T-38s as Advanced Jet Trainers (AJT) and F-5s as Acrobatic Team Aircrafts with a modern high performance multirole aircraft.In addition to these, HÜRJET’s capabilities also extent to:
            
            Replacing aging jet trainers, majority of which are 20 or more years old.
            Being used as Advanced Jet Trainers due to the increasing number of 5th generation aircrafts (TFX, F-35, etc.) and their changing configurations
            Considering the multirole aircraft market, Turkish Aerospace has started HÜRJET Program with the intention of targeting the potential in the market by benefiting from its experience and skills on cost effective design/production of trainer/light aircraft/system.</p>
